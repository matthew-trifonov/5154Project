# Image Captioning Project

This project implements an image captioning model based on the work of **Katariya, Y. (2017)**, available on GitHub:  
[Image-Captioning GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yashk2810/Image-Captioning).

The primary goal of this project is to generate captions for images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), for sequence generation. The model uses the **Flickr8k dataset**, which contains 8,000 images, each paired with five corresponding captions.
